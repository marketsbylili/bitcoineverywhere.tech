title: "Bitcoin in Hostile Environments Questionnaire"
---

To help us adequately assess which bitcoin and communication technologies are best to use in hostile or low bandwidth environments, we created this survey. We are looking for volunteers from third world countries or communities with poor infrastructure, internet censorship, poverty and/or low bandwidth to complete this survey. The survey is anonymous and covers questions regarding bitcoin usage and adoption, internet and communications access, and power infrastructure. Your response will help make our research more effective so that we can recommend and deploy the best bitcoin and communications technologies to those who need it most. We will also use the results to create actionable steps and guidance around communications and bitcoin usage for people living in these types of areas.
