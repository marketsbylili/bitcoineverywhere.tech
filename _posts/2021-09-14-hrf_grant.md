title: "Announcing HRF Bitcoin Dev Fund Grant"
---

We are proud to have received a [generous gift](https://hrf.org/hrfs-bitcoin-development-fund-announces-375-million-satoshis-across-10-q3-gifts/) from the [HRF Bitcoin Dev Fund](https://hrf.org/devfund) for our upcoming [Technology Review](https://bitcoineverywhere.tech/reports/bitcoin_everywhere_tech.html) report. In this report we will collect information from users in Third World economies to help assess the unique challenges they face using Bitcoin. We will review current Bitcoin technology solutions in the context of these challenges. Our conclusion will make recommendations to developers for ways they can better support users in places with limited or lack of: internet connectivity, stable power, financial resources, Bitcoin education and rule-of-law.

This is an open source project and we welcome anyone interested in [contributing](https://bitcoineverywhere.tech/reports/contributing.html) to suggest changes via pull requests to the report or to [review changes](https://github.com/marketsbylili/bitcoineverywhere.tech/pulls) submitted by others.

We are also looking to interview people living in places with unique challenges when using Bitcoin. Once the report is complete we will also need help translating it to different languages. Please get in touch via [telegram](https://t.me/bitcoineverywhere_tech) if you would like to help.
