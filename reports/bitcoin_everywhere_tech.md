<sub>Enabling Technologies for Bitcoin use outside of First World Countries.</sub>

### Introduction
Millions of people around the world live without the luxuries granted in first world counties, and are in dire need of a decentralized, censorship resistant, unconfiscatable, peer-to-peer digital cash known as Bitcoin. However, the use of Bitcoin comes with many challenges that are unique to those in Third World Countries. This report will focus on those challenges and how to best overcome them and get Bitcoin into the hands of those who truly need it. The primary focus of this report is to address the challenges caused by unreliable and/or locally expensive telecommunication and power infrastructure, this can prevent users from sending/receiving bitcoin whenever they need to, which defeats its purpose. This report will also examine operating in jurisdictions where bitcoin has poor legal protection and/or is subject to arbitrary enforcement by potentially corrupt authorities.  And lastly, this report will discuss the trade-offs between custodial and non-custodial solutions, as well as on-chain and off-chain solutions for populations with limited economic resources and education.

Our report will survey existing bitcoin technologies in the context of communities with poor infrastructure, internet censorship, poverty and/or local political risks. Our survey will focus on existing and future bitcoin and lightning mobile wallets, lightning communication technologies, alternative communication systems and existing non-bitcoin technologies.

We will conduct online interviews with target bitcoin users in order to identify issues with existing solutions in their context. The goal of this project will be to provide specific recommendations to bitcoin developers working on building tools for these people and their communities.

This project will be developed as an open-source online report that can be discussed and added to by the community both during and after its release. See [How To Contribute](contributing.md).

### Target Audience

We are creating this report for people living outside of countries typically associated with Bitcoin which have mature economies and political freedom like the USA or Europe. Our target audience may not have access to affordable computing technology beyond a cell phone or reliable telecommunications. They are also less likely to be highly educated or benefit from economic and political stability. 

The problems Bitcoin can solve for our target audience are likely to overlap with those in other countries, but with more emphasis on solving tangible economic problems they face.

The results of this report are meant for software developers who would like to make applications for the Bitcoin network that meet the needs of users outside of first-world countries. The need in the developing world for alternatives to traditional fiat financial services is great so projects that are well adapted to these markets can address a larger user bases than those that only target first-world users. Bitcoin projects in developing countries can also expand more easily across borders by creating tools adapted to countries with similar challenges.

### [Use Cases](technology_review/use_cases.md)

### Research

#### Methodology

To help us assess which Bitcoin and communication technologies are best suited for hostile or low bandwidth environments we are asking people from out target audience to completing an anonymous survey.

Please fill out the survey by clicking the link: [here](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/lv7VEOuagTz7oA3dEQ2xqITi31cBNB1TiGSXGb7jaQU/)

We will periodically publish aggregate responses from the survey. We will also setup interviews with those that leave their contact information. Anonymized highlights from our interviews will be published with permission.

#### Limitations

Our survey and outreach is limited by being in English only and primarily via Twitter and Telegram. This will skew our respondants to include primarily expats and more highly educated and wealthy members of our target audience. We believe this population is still able to comment and give useful information on the situation in their communities. They are also likely to be early adopters and community leaders with highly relevant insights.

### Conclusions

The results of our report are necessarily preliminary due to the limited amount of data we have so far. We will continue to refine this report as people from different regions complete the questionnaire and participate in interviews. We also hope our target audience will comment, [contribute](contributing.md) to this report directly and help create local language versions of the report and questionnaire. This report is intended to be a living document that reflects the best information we have to date.

We need feedback from more regions, particularly in Latin America and Africa. Information from outside of urban areas is also missing and from respondants that do not currently use Bitcoin.

Some challenges and unmet needs we can infer from our questionnaire results and personal interviews are summarized below. 

#### Challenges

* Low merchant adoption
* Banking systems that are hostile to Bitcoin users
* Bitcoin exchanges and services that block non-western users
* Technical ability and understanding of how to use Bitcoin
* Need to transact more than save and with a preference for stable US dollars as a unit of account
* Privacy for personal safety is a concern, in particular from corrupt officials and other criminals
* Telecommunications is available and affordable, but intermittant power outages can disrupt connectivity

#### Unmet Needs

* Easy to use, privacy preserving and localized Bitcoin smart phone wallets and merchant solutions
* Solutions that allow Bitcoin users to transact with stable US dollar denominated balances
* Solutions that do not require banks or regulated western Bitcoin exchanges and services
* Solutions that do not leak information that could make users the target of corrupt officials or other criminals
* Solutions that can still function with out internet access for up to a few hours at a time
