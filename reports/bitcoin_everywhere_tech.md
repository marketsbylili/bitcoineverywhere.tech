title: "Bitcoin Everywhere: Technology Review"
subtitle: "Enabling technologies for bitcoin use outside of the first world."
---

### Introduction
This report looks at technology solutions for bitcoin users living outside of the first world. A primary focus is the challenges caused by unreliable and/or locally expensive telecommunication and power infrastructure. Another is operating in jurisdictions where bitcoin has poor legal protection and/or is subject to arbitrary enforcement by potentially corrupt authorities. We will also examine the trade-offs between custodial and non-custodial solutions for populations with limited economic resources and education.

Our report will survey existing bitcoin technologies in the context of communities with poor infrastructure, internet censorship, poverty and/or local political risks. Our survey will focus on existing and future bitcoin and lightning mobile wallets, lightning communication technologies, alternative communication systems and existing non-bitcoin technologies.

We will conduct online interviews with target bitcoin users in order to identify issues with existing solutions in their context. The goal of this project will be to provide specific recommendations to bitcoin developers working on building tools for these people and their communities.

This project will be developed as an open-source online report that can be discussed and added to by the community both during and after its release. See [How To Contribute](contributing.md).
